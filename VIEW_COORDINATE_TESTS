Grid of 100 x 100 pixels

Centre point of 50 x 50

Using the equation:
```
x = cx + r * cos(a)
y = cy + r * sin(a)
```
Where r is the radius, cx,cy the origin, and a the angle in radians.

Let's try radius = 50 (ie the very edge of the image) and angle = 270 (ie 9 o'clock)

turn 270 into radians:
270 * PI (3.14...) /180 = 4.712

x = 50 + 50 * cos(270)
y = 50 + 50 * sin(270)

x = 100
y = 50

try radius = 50, angle = 90
x = 50
y = 50

try radius = 50, angle = 180
x = 100
y = 50
